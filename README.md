#  Analysis of Factors Affecting Student Academic Performance

**Understanding the factors that influence student academic performance**

A data-driven analysis of student performance data using preprocessing and exploratory data analysis to identify key academic patterns and actionable insights.

## 📊 Project Overview

**The Problem:**  
Educational institutions often struggle to understand why some students underperform despite having access to similar learning resources and environments.

**The Question:**  
Which factors most strongly influence student academic performance, and how are these factors related to outcomes?

**The Answer:**  

Academic performance is driven more by behavioral and study-related factors than by basic demographic attributes, as revealed through systematic data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis.

## 💡 Key Findings

### **1. Study Time Has an Optimal Range**

- Students with moderate study time show the best academic performance 
- Low study time is linked to poor scores 
- Extremely high study time shows diminishing returns
Insight: Quality and consistency matter more than sheer hours

### 2. Attendance and Engagement Matter

- Regular attendance is associated with higher performance
- Low attendance correlates with lower academic outcomes
- Engagement significantly improves results

### 3. Demographics Have Limited Impact

- Gender shows minimal performance difference
- Parental background has weak influence when isolated
- Age-related variation is insignificant


### 4. Support and Resources Influence Outcomes

- Students with academic support show better results
- Lack of support is associated with lower performance
Lesson: External support plays a key role in academic success

### 5. Correlation Alone Misses Key Patterns

-Several features show weak linear correlation with performance
-Visual analysis reveals meaningful trends across groups
Lesson: EDA and visualization are essential for accurate insights

## 🎯 Top Recommendations


- Encourage consistent study habits rather than last-minute or excessive studying.
- Improve student engagement and attendance through interactive learning methods.
- Avoid demographic-based assumptions when assessing academic performance.
- Provide academic support and resources to students showing early signs of poor performance.
- Use visual and exploratory analysis regularly to uncover patterns not visible through summary statistics.
