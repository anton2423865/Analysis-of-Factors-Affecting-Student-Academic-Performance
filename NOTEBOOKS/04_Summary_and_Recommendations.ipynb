    "This comprehensive exploratory data analysis of **649** secondary school students reveals that academic performance is strongly cumulative, with final grades **(G3)** being heavily influenced by earlier assessments **(G1 and G2).** The analysis clearly shows that academic and **behavioral factors—rather than demographic attributes alone—play a decisive role in student outcomes.** Study time and school absences emerged as the most influential controllable factors, while lifestyle and family-related variables contributed to performance variability. Overall, the findings highlight that early academic intervention, consistent study habits, and regular attendance are the most critical levers for improving student success, underscoring the importance of proactive academic support throughout the student lifecycle\n",
